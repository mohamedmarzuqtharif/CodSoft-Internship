Hello, friends!

Welcome to my "CodSoft" repository. During my internship at CodSoft (online), I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, which I am pleased to share here.

Projects Included:

Portfolio Project: A personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, and previous work. This project demonstrates my ability to create a professional and visually appealing online presence using HTML and CSS.

Landing Page Project: A landing page designed to capture the attention of visitors and drive conversions. This project highlights my understanding of responsive design, layout, and user experience principles.

Calculator Project: A functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project allowed me to apply JavaScript to create interactive features and enhance user experience.

Technologies Used: HTML: For the structure and content of the web pages. CSS: For styling, layout, and ensuring the projects are visually engaging and responsive. JavaScript: Specifically in the Calculator project, to add dynamic functionality and interactivity.

How to Use: -> Each project is contained in its own folder. To view a project, simply navigate to the respective folder and open the html file in your web browser. -> The Calculator project includes a JavaScript file to enable its interactive features.

                                                                                Thank You All!!
